    "### Possible challenges in reliable web links extraction\n",
    "* Search Result Snippets: \n",
    "LLMs often rely on the snippets provided by the search engine, which are short summaries of the web page content.  The actual URL might be associated with the entire page, but the LLM might only have access to the snippet and its associated (sometimes truncated or redirected) URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamic Content: \n",
    "Web pages are dynamic.  The content that the search engine indexed might be different from what's on the page when the LLM tries to access it.  This can lead to broken links or content mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Paywalls and Restrictions: \n",
    "Even if the initial search result indicated a publicly accessible page, the website might have implemented changes (paywalls, registration requirements) that restrict access.  The LLM doesn't have a way to \"log in\" or bypass these restrictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* URL Shortening/Tracking: \n",
    "Some websites use URL shorteners or tracking links, which can make it difficult to determine the actual destination URL.  The LLM might present the shortened/tracked link, which could be less reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM Interpretation: \n",
    "Even with the correct URL, the LLM might not always present it correctly in the response.  Sometimes, it can get confused with formatting or other elements in the search result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategies to Improve Link Reliability:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Explicitly Request Links: \n",
    "In your prompt, be very clear that you need the original, fully functional web links.  For example:  \"Provide the full, original web link to each source.  Do not use shortened links or links to search result pages.  I need the direct link to the article or web page itself.\"  The more explicit you are, the better the chances.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Limit Snippet Dependence (If Possible):  \n",
    "If the API allows it, explore options to make the LLM rely less on snippets and more on the actual page content (though this might be more computationally expensive).  This is not always an available option but is worth investigating in the API documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Post-Processing:  \n",
    "The most reliable approach is often to post-process the LLM's output.  This means taking the links provided by the LLM and then programmatically checking them for validity.  You can use a library like requests in Python to make HTTP requests to the URLs and check the status codes (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.).  This allows you to filter out broken links or redirect to paywalls.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Specify Acceptable Domains:  \n",
    "If you're looking for information from specific, reputable sources, you can tell the LLM to prioritize those domains.  This can increase the likelihood of getting reliable links.  For example, \"Focus on sources from reputable news organizations like the New York Times, Reuters, or the Wall Street Journal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Iterative Refinement: \n",
    "If you get a broken link, try rephrasing your query or requesting the information again.  Sometimes, the LLM might provide a different link on a subsequent attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Human Verification: \n",
    "For critical information, always verify the links and the content yourself.  LLMs are powerful tools, but they are not perfect.  Human oversight is still essential.\n"
